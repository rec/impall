# ðŸ›Ž Test-import all modules ðŸ›Ž

Individually and separately imports each Python module or file in a project and
reports warnings or failures at the end.

### Running impall as a unit test

Just inherit from the base class and it will
automatically find and import each file, like this.

    import impall

    class ImpAllTest(impall.ImpAllTest):
        pass

(You can copy
[this file](https://github.com/rec/impall/blob/master/all_test.py)
into your project if you like.)

Tests are customized by overriding one of these following properties in the
derived class.

    CLEAR_SYS_MODULES, EXCLUDE, FAILING, INCLUDE, MODULES, PATHS,
    RAISE_EXCEPTIONS, and WARNINGS_ACTION.

For example, to turn warnings into errors, set the property
WARNINGS_ACTION in the derived class definition, like this.

    class ImpAllTest(impall.ImpAllTest):
        WARNINGS_ACTION = 'error'

## Running impall as a command-line utility

    $ impall.py --warnings_action=error
    $ impall.py -w error

The properties INCLUDE, EXCLUDE, and PROJECT_PATH can be
lists of strings, or a string separated with colons like
'foo.mod1:foo.mod2'

INCLUDE and EXCLUDE match modules, and also allow * as a wildcard.
A single * matches any module segment, and a double ** matches any
remaining segments. For example,

INCLUDE = 'foo', 'bar.*', 'baz.**'

* matches `foo` but not `foo.foo`
* matches `bar.foo` but not `bar` or `bar.foo.bar`
* matches `baz.foo` as well as `baz.foo.bar` but not `baz`

### A note on side-effects

to reduce side-effects, `sys.modules` is restored to its original
condition after each import if CLEAR_SYS_MODULES is true, but there might be
other side-effects from loading some specific module.

Use the EXCLUDE property to exclude modules with undesirable side
effects. In general, it is probably a bad idea to have significant
side-effects just from loading a module.
